#  This is my response essay for the required reading "An Industry Guide to Becoming a Software Engineer"
## By Bill Langenberg


Software Engineering has a history of scaring me in the past. I usually learn best with hands on experience
and thats hard to do when trying to jump into programming. Any time I've attempted to learn more about 
a programming language or computer science in general, it starts out basic enough that I can easily follow
and then it jumps into complete hieroglyphics and I lose sight on how it all ties together. 

He mentions how you should understand one language really well. Know the language mechanics and frequently
used patterns and built-ins. Perhaps this is one of the many reasons I've felt lost when trying to learn.
I jump from one class where I learn the basics of C on to another class for basics with Python. Next 
thing I know my buddy who is a programmer tells me how important it is that I learn Java and trys to get 
me to learn the basics and its just information overload. It would probably help if I invested the time
to fully learn and understand all the ins and outs of one specific language. Then apply that knowledge 
to understand other languages quicker.

For problem solving he mentions having a methodical approach. I couldn't agree more and believe such an
approach applies to almost any problem solving situation. I think of myself as a pretty detailed person
and get quite a bit of enjoyment out of working my way through an issue and coming up with a solution.
Although there is always that exception where it downright frustrates you. 

In the section "Tying It Together" I'm not sure if were supposed to understand this code because
I'm completly lost. I like how he breaks it down and explains how he improves it but I have basically
zero knowledge of Java so I had no idea anything was wrong in the first place. 

He lays out some great information on what he believes you should be farmiliar with for taking a new server,
installing a linux distro, and setting up a basic webserver. In this section he mentions being comfortable going
to the web for answers. I think this is something worth mentioning because it can be good and bad. The 
web is full of great and also useless information. Knowing how and where to look can help tremendously in a
variety of situations. That also doesn't mean anytime you have the smallest of errors or issues you should
fire up a search engine as oppose to working out the issue yourself. 

"Choose the right tool for the job" This section is important because I believe it shows how important 
it can be to alter your way of thinking to try to solve a problem or task more efficiently. 

This has been a valuable read and shows me how much futher I have to go before I even crack the surface 
of Software Engineering. I need to start investing even more free time into being proactive and learning things
that may not even apply to me at the moment, but will surely apply to me in the future.
