# Bootable USB Customization Documentation

I havn't done a ton of customization yet other than installing a few programs
that I enjoy using and setting it up to my preferences. 

First I got github setup so I can easily partake in assignments. 

Some programs and packages I installed -

    KDE PLASMA Desktop Enviorment
    Chromium
    Dropbox
    Notepadqq
    
Most of these are simple installs from the offical repository.

**However Dropbox is in the AUR Arch User Repository and must be installed by following**

    https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_User_Repository#Installing_packages
    https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/dropbox/
    
I also changed some basic preferences to fit my tastes such as - 

    Changed my panels and widgets
    Changed to the Breeze Dark Theme and Look and Feel
    Edited some basic Desktop Behavior and shortcuts in some programs to reflect my habits.
    
I have a lot of plans to tweak and personalize my install to get it exactly how I want it.
